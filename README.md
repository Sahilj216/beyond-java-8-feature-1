Q6)You are tasked with writing a processOrderStatus method that takes an OrderStatus enum as input and returns a descriptive string based on the order status. Here's the OrderStatus enum: public enum OrderStatus { PENDING, PROCESSING, SHIPPED, DELIVERED, CANCELLED, REFUNDED } Your processOrderStatus method should adhere to the following rules: For PENDING orders, return: "Order is awaiting confirmation." For PROCESSING orders, return: "Order is being prepared." For SHIPPED orders, return: "Order has been dispatched." For DELIVERED orders, return: "Order has been successfully delivered." For CANCELLED orders, return: "Order has been canceled." For REFUNDED orders, return: "Refund has been issued for the order." Use a single switch expression to achieve this. Enhancements: yield Keyword: If your logic requires more complex processing within a case, demonstrate the use of the yield keyword to return a value from the switch expression.
